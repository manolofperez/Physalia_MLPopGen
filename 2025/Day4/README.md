### Day 4

Thursday â€“ Classes from 2 to 8 pm Berlin time

- Introduction to approaches for detecting selection
- Recognizing signatures of selection with deep learning 
- Practical: simulating genetic data and using CNN to predict whether a given locus is under selection 

### Schedule (Berlin time)

- 14.00 - 15.15 session 1: introduction to detecting selection signals
- break 15m
- 15.30 - 16.45 session 2: deep learning to detect selection + guided exercise
- break 30m
- 17.15 - 18.30 session 3: independent exercise to detect selection using deep learning
- break 15m
- 18.45 - 20.00 session 4: Q&A session on the whole course (how are you going to apply these methods to your system? are there features of your system that we did not mention?)
