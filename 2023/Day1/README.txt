# This folder contains executables for Linux and Mac of the coalescent simulator ms (Hudson 2002). 
# The software is already installed in the AWS EC2 server, so these files are only for you to use after the course. 

# If you receive an error message about permission, just use the following command:

chmod 777 ms
chmod 777 sample_stats


# The file PopPlanner.jar contains a program that should run on all platforms (given that Java is installed). 
# This program uses a graphical representation of the ms commands, to help conceiving the models.

#The file figtree.jar is a software to visualize trees and should also work on all platforms.

#The file simulate_Esegueriana.ipynb contains the script to simulate data for one of the species in the Kirschner et al. (2022) Nat. Comm. paper.
