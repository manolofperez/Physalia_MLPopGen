# Deep learning methods in population genomics and phylogeography

A four days course taught by Manolo Perez and Matteo Fumagalli on deep learning approaches for population genetics and phylogeography based on genomic data. Classes were focused in the basic concepts on modelling demographic history with genetic data simulators, supervised deep learning to learn directly from genetic data, comparing demographic scenarios, and recognizing signatures of selection. All scripts, slides and tutorials can be found here.
